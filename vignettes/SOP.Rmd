# Introduction

At a high level, the `SBCpip` package provides an interface to a model that predicts blood platelet
usage based on hospital data over time. It also recommends the number of units that should be 
collected to satisfy future usage. The model itself is specified in the `pip` package, and it relies 
on time-series prediction using a linear program (based on work by @Guan11368)

We anticipate that most users of this package will be practitioners at hospitals and blood centers 
rather than R developers, so this vignette is concerned with preparing data and setting up the dashboard 
to make predictions. A fuller technical treatment of the package is given in this [vignette](SOP_dev.html).

# Quick Start

## Package Installation
To get started, enter the following commands in the R console (via terminal command line or in RStudio) :

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

devtools::install_github(repo = "https://github.com/okadak126/pip")
devtools::install_github(repo = "https://github.com/okadak126/SBCpip")
library(pip)
library(SBCpip)
```

This will allow the user to start the dashboard by running 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
sbc_dashboard()
```

## Data Preparation

### Overview
`SBCpip` relies on 5 different file types. Each of the below file types must be added to the same data folder for each date used in making the prediction:

1. **CBC:** Results of Complete Blood Count (CBC) tests on hospital patients on a given date. The goal is to identify abnormal levels in hospital patients and use these instances as inputs to the model (1 row = 1 unique measurement)
2. **Census:** Locations of patients in the hospital system (e.g. rooms, wards) on a given date. The goal is to identify specific locations that are increasing hospital demand for specific blood products. (1 row = 1 unique patient)
3. **Surgery:** Surgeries carried out by hospital on a given date (or scheduled to be performed in the next 3 days). The goal is to identify particular surgery types that are increasing hospital demand for specific blood products. (1 row = 1 unique operation)
4. **Transfusion:** Transfusions that occur at the hospital on a given date. This is the response which we try to predict (transfusions over next 2 or 3 days) (1 row = 1 unique transfusion of a blood product).
5. **Inventory:** Blood products collected and available in inventory for issue to hospital / transfusions. We use this to compare model performance to actual historical protocol (1 row = 1 unit). Note that inventory files should be in .xlsx format.


### Data Compatibility
The information contained in each type of file will be organization-specific. Required columns from each file type are stipulated in the template file `extdata/sbc_data_mapping.csv`, which should be completed by the user prior to running the dashboard.

In order to open the mapping file, run the following commands in R (commands will differ based on operating system):
```{r, eval=FALSE}
sbc_data_mapping <- system.file(package = "SBCpip", "extdata", "sbc_data_mapping.csv")

# Windows Users
shell(sbc_data_mapping, wait=FALSE)

# Mac OS Users
system(paste0("open ", sbc_data_mapping), wait=FALSE)
```

The user should change the values in the "org_data_column_to_edit" column to column names in their organization's data files that correspond to each column described in the mapping. Below is a summary of the required fields for each file type:

| Data File  |SBC Column Name | Description                                                                                    | Data Type/Format                            |

### Additional CBC Data Preparation
The CBC inputs are pre-processed differently from the other files, as the model accepts counts of patients whose CBC levels fall below a certain threshold (or above, in the case of White Blood Cell levels). Quantiles and abnormal levels must be defined for the specific CBC components that the user would like to include as inputs to the model, and this is handled using the provided template file `extdata/cbc_thresholds.csv`.

The steps to open and modify this file are similar to those of the mapping file:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
cbc_thresholds <- system.file(package = "SBCpip", "extdata", "cbc_thresholds.csv")

# Windows Users
shell(cbc_thresholds, wait=FALSE)

# Mac OS Users
system(paste0("open ", cbc_thresholds), wait=FALSE)
```

For each CBC component of interest, the user must specify the following fields in the file (for both quantiles and abnormals):

#### Quantiles
* `metric` = "quantile"
* `base_name` = CBC component, e.g. "PLT"
* `type` = "literal" (quantile is a fixed value) or "quantile" (quantile is computed based with respect to given data)
* `value` = either the literal value (for "literal") or the p-quantile to be computed (for "quantile", 0 < p < 1) that defines the threshold below which the patient's levels would be considered low (high for White Blood Cells) 

#### Abnormals
* `metric` = "abnormal"
* `base_name` = CBC component, e.g. "PLT"
* `type` = "less" or "greater" depending on the direction of abnormality
* `value` = the threshold value below ("less") or above ("greater") which we consider the level "abnormal"

Note that CBC components for which a quantile and abnormal designation is not provided will be ignored as inputs to the model (a warning will be issued). Below is an example of possible entries in the file:

|metric   |base_name |type     | value|
|:--------|:---------|:--------|-----:|
|quantile |HGB       |quantile |  0.25|
|abnormal |HGB       |less     |  9.00|

The first line would be interpreted as "include in model input counts of patients below the 25th percentile in terms of hemoglobin". The second line would be interpreted as "consider hemoglobin levels less than 9 to be abnormal".

# Running the Dashboard

<!-- ![](dashboard_overview.png) -->

The Shiny Dashboard interface provides a greatly simplified way to accomplish model training and prediction
tasks. It is launched by running the following command:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(SBCpip)
sbc_dashboard()
```

The Dashboard consists of the following seven tabs, arranged in order of their 
expected usage for prediction tasks:

## Database Settings

![](images/1database_settings.png) 

#### Instructions

1. Specify the local paths to the database, the data folder, and the log folder, as well as filename prefixes for each type of data file under "Filename Patterns". Then click **Save File Settings**. If you have already done this in a previous session, click **Load File Settings**. 

2. Click **Refresh Features** to pull in a complete list of features from each file type in the provided data folder. Use the picklists to select features believed to be the most relevant. Then click **Save Features**. If you have already done this in a previous session, click **Load Features**.

3. Click **Apply Database Settings** and then **Build Database** on the lefthand panel. This operation will take several minutes to complete. It builds a database based on every data file in the specified data folder.

#### Tips

- To determine appropriate paths for the Input and Output Locations, run the following `setwd("~");getwd()` in the R console. This will return the home directory (e.g. "/Users/myname"). Then append appropriate subfolders such as "/Desktop/mydata".

- The DuckDB file need not exist - the program will create it when the database is built.

- Filename prefixes for each file type should immediately precede the date for the particular file. For example, if the prefix for a Census file is `Hospital_Census_Data`, the name of the Census file obtained on March 10, 2020, should begin `Hospital_Census_Data2020-03-10`

- To experiment with synthetic sample data, run the following in R:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
sample_data <- system.file(package = "SBCpip", "extdata", "platelet_data_sample.zip")
unzip(sample_data, exdir = "mydirectory") # Adjust the exdir path. The data folder is "mydirectory/platelet_data_sample"
```

## Reports 
![](images/2reports.png) 

#### Instructions

1. Reports are primarily for querying and sanity-checking the built database. Provide a range of dates
(or a single date) to analyze and click **Summarize**. This displays the mean and standard deviations of
each of the features over the date range.

## Model Settings
This allows the user to set model training parameters such as the 
(positive) prediction bias, number of previous days used in training window, and hyperparameter values.
The dashboard provides some additional intuition regarding the effects of modifying each of these parameters.

## Validate Model Over Range
Once the Model Training parameters are set, the user can then
run predictions over a specified range of dates and compare the usage predictions and waste generate against "true"
values of usage and waste according to the true historical protocol. The result displays a summary of 
prediction error, waste, shortage, and nonzero coefficients in the model. As predictions are cached in the
database, the user can then restart the Dashboard and click "Summary Table" over the same range of dates to
skip running the model and display the analysis from a previous prediction.

## Predict for Today
This assumes the user would like to run a prediction of 
expected platelet usage over the next 3 days (including today) without necessarily 
being able to validate against ground truth (i.e. use the model in practice). 
The user must input the number of inventory platelets expiring at the end of the 
day on the specified date as well as on the following day, and the number of fresh
platelets scheduled to become available for use on those dates. This allows the
model to both predict the three day usage *and* recommend the number of platelets
that should be collected today so that they may be available for use in 2 days and
satisfy the anticipated demand. The model may or may not need to retrain depending
on the `model_update_freqency` specified in Part 3 - in any case, the model also
outputs a list of the most non-zero valued coefficients by their absolute value.

## Prediction Plots
This plots 6 line graphs for the specified date range, 
which can correspond to either predictions made over a range of dates in Part 4 or Part 5:

- Predicted vs. actual next-three-day usage for each day.
- Collection recommendations over time for each day
- Model's generated waste vs. number of platelets remaining in inventory that 
expire the following day (waste precursor)
- True waste vs. number of platelets remaining in inventory that 
expire the following day (based on policy carried out in practice)
- Model's shortage vs. number of platelets remaining in inventory that expire
in 2 days (shortage precursor)
- True shortage vs. number of platelets remaining in inventory that expire
in 2 days (based on policy carried out in practice)
  
## Coefficient Plots
For a given range of dates with predictions, the user 
can select coefficients from a picklist, and the dashboard will plot their evolution over time.
They are plotted against `Coefficient L1 Bound`, which is the constraint on the absolute value of the sum
of the coefficients (this ensures a sparse model by L1 regularization). 

The Dashboard interface includes annotations regarding the effect of changing the 
model training parameters, as well as more fine-grained usage instructions.
