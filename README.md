# SBCpip


## Overview
`SBCpip` is an R package for processing Stanford Blood Center
data. The data can then be fed to the [Platelet Inventory Prediction
(`pip`)](https://bnaras.github.io/pip) package. 

This separation allows each organization to build appropriate data
processing workflows for local data in site-specific packages and not
worry about the site-independent parts in the `pip` package.
